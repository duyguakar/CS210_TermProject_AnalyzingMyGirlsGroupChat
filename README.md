# Analyzing My Girls' Group Chat
  
  Description
  This project aims to profile the texting habits of participants in a sample Girls Whatsapp Groupchat and calculate their correlation to engagement. Through the exploration of various texting styles, high frequency periods, and media sharing tendencies the project aims to offer suggestions to maximize engagement.
  
  Potential questions that will be inspected throughout the analysis are the comparison between the message activity and the time of the day to find out if the group activity peaks at certain hours; the frequency of the keywords such as "sorry" and "congrats" to map group dynamics; and the count of media files as well as the follow-up messages they generate to explore if media files lead to higher engagement in the form of replies.
  
  In a greater context, profiling participants according to their previous interactions, texting styles, media sharing tendencies, and keyword use might help constitute and manage groups that will maximize engagement.
