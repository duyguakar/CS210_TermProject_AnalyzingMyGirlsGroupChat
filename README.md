# CS210_TermProject_AnalyzingMyGirlsGroupChat
  This project aims to profile the texting habits of participants in a sample Girls Whatsapp Groupchat and calculate their correlation to engagement. Through the exploration of various texting styles, high frequency periods, and media sharing tendencies the project aims to offer suggestions to maximize engagement.
  
  Potential questions that will be inspected throughout the analysis are the comparison between the message activity and the time of the day to find out if the group activity peaks at certain hours; the frequency of the keywords such as "sorry" and "congrats" to map group dynamics; and the count of media files as well as the follow-up messages they generate to explore if media files lead to higher engagement in the form of replies.

  The primary data source of the project will be implemented using WhatsAppâ€™s export chat feature to retrieve text files of the group chat history. To process and clean data, Phyton libraries such as pandas and re will be used. The data will then be visualized using matplotlib, seaborn or plotly to create various charts exploring the characteristics of the conversation. Text analysis will then be implemented using nltk or TextBlob to manage keyword extraction correctly. Finally, the correlation will be calculated using scipy.stats.

In a greater context, profiling participants according to their previous interactions, texting styles, media sharing tendencies, and keyword use might help constitute and manage groups that will maximize engagement.
